He decided to pursue criminology because of the strong influence of his grandfather, a retired police officer. Dauzil has always looked up to his grandfather, who spent his career serving the community and upholding justice. Inspired by his grandfather’s dedication, Dauzil hopes to follow in his footsteps and make a positive impact in the world through a career in law enforcement.

    dauzil believes that studying criminology will equip him with the knowledge and skills needed to help make society safer and more just for everyone. Growing up in Pangpang, a rural area in Sorsogon City, Dauzil has always been aware of the challenges that law enforcement officers face, especially in less urbanized areas. He has seen firsthand how important the role of the police is in maintaining peace, protecting the public, and enforcing the law. This understanding has been a big motivator for him to pursue criminology, as he wants to make a difference in his own community, just like his grandfather did throughout his career.

    Dauzil is also fortunate to be a city scholar under the scholarship program of Mayor Ester Hamor. The scholarship helps with the financial costs of college, which allows him to focus more on his studies and work hard to achieve his goals. He is thankful for the support and strives to do his best in his academics to honor the opportunity he’s been given. Outside of his studies, Dauzil has a few hobbies that help him stay active and unwind from the pressures of school. Basketball is a big part of his life. He plays regularly with his friends and classmates, and it’s not just a way to stay fit—it’s also taught him valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. These are qualities that he believes will serve him well in his future career in criminology. Basketball is also a great way for him to relieve stress, which helps him stay focused on his studies and keep a balanced lifestyle.

    Dauzil is also into online gaming, which he enjoys for both the challenge and the strategy involved. Gaming has helped him improve his critical thinking, and it’s also a good way to connect with others. The teamwork and communication skills he picks up through gaming will definitely be useful in criminology, where those abilities are crucial. On top of that, Dauzil enjoys playing chess, which sharpens his decision-making and problem-solving skills. Chess requires patience and careful planning—traits that are important for his studies and future career in law enforcement. As a criminology student, Dauzil is learning a lot about crime, the legal system, and the justice process. He’s particularly interested in criminal psychology and investigative techniques. He believes that understanding how criminals think and the methods used to solve crimes will make him a more effective and compassionate law enforcement professional.
